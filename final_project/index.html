			<h2>The Purpose of This Website</h2>
			<p> The purpose of this website is to provide you with the best recipes for Thanksgiving meals. This website will provide
				recipes for different times of the day including Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. This home page will provide my personal favorite
				Thanksgiving dinners, with the other pages in the navigation menu containing Breakfast and Lunch. Keep in mind that these choices
				are not objectively the best recipes to choose from but are rather subjective based upon my own opinions. The recipes listed
				are not numbered in any order in terms of rating.

			<h1>Dinner Recipe Descriptors</h1>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>Good Eats Turkey</h3>
				<p>The Good Eats Turkey is an amazing choice for a delicious Thanksgiving dinner. A turkey for Thanksgiving is the most generic choice for dinners
				   but is also widely considered the most necesarry for a Thanksgiving dinner. This turkey consists of a coating of brown sugar, and many vegetables for the aromatics
				   to give the turkey a delicious taste. This turkey will have a different taste compared to an averagely cooked turkey as it will taste more juicy and not as dry. Many can
				   say that this turkey rivals ham at a Thanksgiving feast. </p> </li>
				<li><h3>Baked Macaroni and Cheese</h3>
				<p>The Baked Macaroni & Cheese is a delectible choice to add to your Thanksgiving feast as it adds many different flavors and variety to the dinner table.
				   This cheesy choice can have your guests begging for more as it uses a lot of cheese and butter to be made. This dish also has a bread like finish on the top
				   to give it extra texture and make it a lot more enjoyable to eat and serve. </p> </li>
				<li><h3>French Apple Tart</h3>
				<p>The French Apple Tart is a tasty treat as an add on to the other two recipes provided. The French Apple Tart will act almost as a desert for your guests with it's sweet
				   and fruity flavor. This recipe incorporates apples into it's dish and adds an explosive punch to you and your guests taste buds. This dish would be best served after the
				   main feast and as a side to the other enjoyable food you will serve.</p> </li>
				<li><h3>Spinach Gratin</h3>
				<p> The Spinach Gratin would be a great appetizer for your guests on Thanksgiving day. In my opinion spinach dip paired with chips is the king of appetizers as it is a more healthy choice compared to others
					and it has an extremely great taste. This dish uses alot of cheese and butter to give the spinach a better taste than if it were to be baked plain.
					This does take away many nutritional benefits the spinach once had but something is better than nothing, and it tastes amazing.</p></li>
