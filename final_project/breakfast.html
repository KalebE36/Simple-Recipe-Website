				<li><h3>Egg & Hash Brown Casserole</h3>
				<p>An egg & hash brown casserole is a delectable choice for the morning of thanksgiving. It containts breakfast like ingredients
           with the likes of eggs and hashbrowns, which happen to be two of my favorite breakfast items. I would highly recommend this dish
           to anyone who wants to excite their guests with good and delicious food.</p></li>
				<li><h3>Perfect Fruit Scones</h3>
				<p>The fruit scones are a perfect choice for someone who wants to give their guests something with a lighter stomach load and taste rather
           than something that would be more of a gut load. I personally like the fruit scones for their warm and soft texture which allows for an
           enjoyable eating experience.</p> </li>
				<li><h3>Pot Hash</h3>
				<p>This pot hash is quite the force to be reckoned with compared to the other breakfast foods as it contains some of the breakfast items that most
           people would enjoy, such as potatoes, bacon, and eggs. The Pot Hash would be a great choice for someone who wants to contain all of these items
           into a single dish; which would provide a tasteful experience to all of the guests who are willing to try this food.</p> </li>
				<li><h3>Breakfast Bombs</h3>
				<p>The Breakfast Bomb is the bomb when compared to its breakfast counterparts. This breakfast choice is a biscuit with many enjoyable ingredients including
           eggs, bacon, and cheese while being cooked to a nice warm temperature. This is a nice introductory food before the days festivities of good eating and large
           feasts. </p></li>
